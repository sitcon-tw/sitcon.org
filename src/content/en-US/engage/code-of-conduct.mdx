SITCON aspires to create a stage that is of the students, by the students and for the students. We are dedicated to creating a friendly and open environment for every member of our community. We believe each individual involved in our community activities deserves to be respected. We do our utmost to provide the safest environment possible, where everyone who participates in SITCON can understand individual differences, support each other within the community, and be encouraged to express their individuality.

Therefore, if we are fortunate enough to meet you within the SITCON community, whether you are a participant, sponsor, staff member or speaker, we kindly ask you to observe the following behavioral guidelines:

- Respect all participants and consider their feelings.
- Avoid using words, speeches, and body gestures that are insulting, discriminatory, or potentially harassing.
- Be mindful of your fellow community members and set aside some time to help when necessary.
- Seek help from staff members if you encounter danger or detect something amiss.
- Make friends during the event and treasure the moments we spend together.

The following actions are not tolerated in our community:

- Discriminatory behavior, including provocations, offenses, misnaming, or differential treatment against gender, sexual orientation, race, appearance, religion, age, physical condition or individual identity.
- Harassing behavior, including sexual harassment, nicknames or physical contact that causes discomfort, and any form of verbal or physical bullying.
- Publicly express, display, or screen speeches or images that contain insults, discrimination, hatred, violence, or sexual innuendo.
- Disrupt the program or event without due cause and ignore requests for cessation from staff or participants.
- Interfere with or attack the event venue's network, collect or disseminate personal information without consent.
- Any other actions that violate the law.

To ensure the safety of all participants, we will strictly adhere to these rules. Participants who violate these behavioral guidelines will be dealt with necessary and reasonable interventions, including but not limited to removing them from the event, removing their names from the relevant roster or listing them as unwelcome, or referring to police authorities when necessary. If you or someone else encounters the above situations, or has any other concerns, please seek assistance from SITCON staff immediately.

We sincerely invite friends who come to SITCON to come together to fulfill the above commitments, and to build SITCON into a friendlier and warmer place. We want each participant to grow together in community exchanges, and to find confidence in human interactions - which is the true spirit of our valued student community that we cherish.
